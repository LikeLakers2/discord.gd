# Discord.gd
Hello! This is a work-in-progress implementation of the Discord API, written for the Godot Engine.

## Progress
The implementation currently handles maintaining a connection to the gateway, as well as emitting signals whenever a DISPATCH or unknown opcode is received, but does not provide any API abstractions such as sending messages. If that doesn't deter you, then you are free to use it in its current state. Otherwise, I recommend waiting for further updates.
